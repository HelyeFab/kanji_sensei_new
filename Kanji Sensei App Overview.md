Kanji Sensei App Overview
Based on my exploration of the codebase, I can provide you with a comprehensive overview of the Kanji Sensei application:

Project Summary
Kanji Sensei is a Flutter application designed for learning Japanese kanji characters. It follows Clean Architecture principles and uses the BLoC pattern for state management. The app is currently in development with some features already implemented and others planned for future phases.

Architecture
The app follows a well-structured Clean Architecture approach with clear separation of concerns:

Presentation Layer: UI components, screens, and BLoC state management
Domain Layer: Business logic, entities, and repository interfaces
Data Layer: Repository implementations, API services, and local data services
Core Layer: Shared utilities, constants, and dependency injection
Key Features Implemented
Improved JLPT Kanji Retrieval System
Two-Phase Loading: Initial quick loading of the first batch (20 kanji) followed by background loading of all remaining kanji
Pagination: Navigation through large sets of kanji with prev/next controls
Caching: Efficient storage of kanji data using Hive for faster subsequent access
Background Processing: Continuous loading in the background while users interact with initial results
Progress Indicators: Visual feedback showing loading status
Dictionary Search
Search for Japanese words using the Jisho API
Display of word details including readings, meanings, and example sentences
Clean UI with search bar and result cards
Authentication
Firebase Authentication integration
Email/password and Google Sign-in support
Authentication state management with BLoC
Data Sources
KanjiAPI Service: External API for retrieving kanji data
Local Data Service: Bundled JSON files for reliable JLPT level kanji data
Fallback Mechanism: Gracefully falls back to API if local data fails
Technical Implementation
State Management
Uses BLoC pattern with custom events and states
Handles loading states, errors, and pagination
Background loading with StreamSubscription
Caching Strategy
Implements Hive for persistent storage of kanji data
Caches individual kanji and JLPT level sets
Tracks cache completeness with flags
Dependency Injection
Uses GetIt for service locator pattern
Manages dependencies between layers
Provides singleton and factory instances as needed
Current Status
Based on the README and code exploration, the project appears to be in Phase 2 or 3 of its implementation roadmap:

âœ… Project Setup (Phase 1)
âœ… Core Functionalities (Phase 2)
ðŸ”„ Authentication & Database (Phase 3)
ðŸ”„ Additional Features (Phase 4)
ðŸ”„ UI & UX Refinement (Phase 5)
ðŸ”„ Testing & Monitoring (Phase 6)
Main Screens
Dictionary Screen: Search for Japanese words and view their details
Kanji Search Screen: Search for kanji by JLPT level or query
Word Collection Screen: View saved words (in development)
Profile Screen: User profile and settings (in development)
Planned Features
According to the README, these features are planned for future phases:

Flashcard creation (auto/manual)
Quizzes and spaced repetition
Progress tracking dashboard
Offline capabilities
UI & UX refinement with custom designs and theming
