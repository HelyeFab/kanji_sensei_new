# Kanji Sensei

A Flutter application for learning Japanese kanji characters.

## Features

### Improved JLPT Kanji Retrieval System

The app features an optimized kanji retrieval system for JLPT levels with:

- **Two-Phase Loading**: Initial quick loading of the first batch (20 kanji) followed by background loading of all remaining kanji
- **Pagination**: Easy navigation through large sets of kanji with prev/next controls
- **Caching**: Efficient storage of kanji data for faster subsequent access
- **Background Processing**: Continuous loading in the background while users interact with the initial results
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback showing loading status

### Technical Implementation

- **State Management**: Uses BLoC pattern with custom events for initial loading, background loading, and pagination
- **Caching Strategy**: Implements Hive for persistent storage of kanji data and JLPT level sets
- **Local Data Integration**: Uses bundled JSON files for reliable JLPT level kanji data
- **API Integration**: Optimized KanjiAPI service with specialized methods for different loading scenarios
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Gracefully falls back to API if local data fails
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows repository pattern with clear separation of concerns

## Getting Started

### Local Kanji Data Integration

The app now uses local JSON data files for JLPT level kanji retrieval, providing several benefits:

- **Reliability**: No dependency on external API availability for core JLPT level data
- **Performance**: Faster loading times with bundled data
- **Accuracy**: Guaranteed correct JLPT level assignments
- **Offline First**: Works without internet connection for JLPT level browsing
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Gracefully falls back to API if local data fails

The local data is organized by JLPT level in the `lib/assets/kanji_data/` directory, with each level having its own JSON file containing the complete set of kanji for that level.

### Kanji Flashcards Flutter App Development Plan

### Overview

Create a Kanji study app tailored for individual learners at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, leveraging Flutter, Clean Architecture, Firebase, and Bloc for state management. The app targets iOS, Android, and future web/desktop expansions.

## Feature List

### Core Features

#### Flashcards

- Automatic creation of flashcards from Kanji API data:

  - Kanji character
  - Readings (on'yomi and kun'yomi)
  - Meanings
  - Stroke count
  - Radicals
  - Example sentences
- Manual flashcard creation by users (fields above customizable)
- Categorization of flashcards into decks by JLPT levels and user-created folders

#### Quizzes and Spaced Repetition

- Interactive quizzes to test user knowledge
- Spaced repetition algorithm to reinforce learning

#### Progress Tracking

- User dashboards to view progress, statistics, and milestones

#### Offline Mode

- Local caching of flashcards and Kanji API responses
- Synchronization when connection resumes

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture (Clean Architecture)

#### Presentation Layer
- Flutter UI components
- Bloc state management

#### Domain Layer
- Business logic entities
- Use cases (flashcard management, quizzes, progress tracking)

#### Data Layer
- Repositories to abstract data sources
- API service for KanjiAPI
- Firebase Firestore integration
- Local caching (Hive)

#### Core Layer
- Shared utilities (network checker, caching handler, error handling)

### State Management
- Bloc Pattern
- Structured, testable state management

### UI/UX Design
- Custom-styled Flutter UI for enhanced user experience
- Dynamic theming (light/dark mode)
- System theme respect with manual toggle option

### Firebase Integration

#### Authentication
- Email/password, Google Sign-in, Apple Sign-in

#### Firestore
- Storage for user-generated flashcards and progress data

### API Integration

#### KanjiAPI
- Retrieve kanji by JLPT level or individual search
- Optimized background loading for complete JLPT level sets
- Caching retrieved data locally
- Graceful handling of API downtime (fallback to local cache)

### Testing and Monitoring

#### Automated testing from project start
- Unit tests
- Widget tests
- Integration tests

#### Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics for
- User interaction monitoring
- Stability monitoring and reporting
